# Principles

* **Identify the aspects of your application that vary and separate them from what stays the same**
  * Take the parts that vary and encapsulate them, so that later you can alter or extend the parts that vary without affecting those that donâ€™t.
* **Program to an interface, not an implementation**
* **Favor composition over inheritance**
  * The HAS-A relationship can be better than IS-A. It lets you change behavior at runtime.
